    - Add support for asset-based extension injection during Conjure IR publishing.
    - Assets can now provide key-value pairs for the IR `extensions` block via the new `--assets` flag on `conjure-publish`.
    - Only assets of type `conjure-ir-extensions-provider` are supported; asset invocation order is indeterminate.
